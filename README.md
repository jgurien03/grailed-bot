A simple discord bot fork of my own Grailed scraper which you can find at [https://github.com/jgurien03/Grailed-Scraper](https://github.com/jgurien03/Grailed-Scraper). Currently, it is not hosted, so you can host it on your own computer if you'd like, just make sure to use your own bot token. Results may be affected by factors such as processing power and WiFi, as this is a web-based crawler that will yield different results based on performance.

**TO DO:**
- Get hosted
- Fix infinite scroll timeout
- Update model's database to yield lower validation loss
- Include more dataframe options
