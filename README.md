A simple fork of my own grailed scraper which you can find at https://github.com/jgurien03/Grailed-Scraper
Currently is not hosted, so you can host it on your own computer if you'd like, just make sure to use your own bot token.
Results may be affected by factors such as processing power and WiFi, as this is a web-based crawler that will yield different results based on performance.

TO DO:
  Get hosted
  Fix infinite scroll timeout
  Update model's database to yield lower validation loss
  Include more dataframe options
